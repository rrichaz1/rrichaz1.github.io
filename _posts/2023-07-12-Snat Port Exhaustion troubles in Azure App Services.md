Azure App Service imposes limits on the number of outbound connections that can be outstanding at any given point in time. These limits vary depending on the pricing tier and instance size:

- B1/S1/P1 instances: 1,920 connections
- B2/S2/P2 instances: 3,968 connections
- B3/S3/P3 instances: 8,064 connections
- I1/I2/I3 instances: 16,000 connections

For App Service Environments (ASE), the maximum upper limit is 64,000 connections.



The issue of SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) port exhaustion in Azure App Service occurs when an application repeatedly opens new connections to the same host and port combination, which exceeds the initial allocation of 128 SNAT ports. This can result in intermittent outbound connectivity issues, including slow response times, 5xx or Bad Gateway errors, timeouts, and failed attempts to connect to external endpoints like SQL databases, Service Fabric, or other App Services.

To avoid SNAT port exhaustion, you can implement several strategies:

1. **Connection pooling**: By pooling your connections, you avoid opening new network connections for calls to the same address and port. This reduces the likelihood of hitting the SNAT port limit.

2. **Service endpoints**: Using service endpoints allows you to avoid SNAT port restrictions to services secured with service endpoints.

3. **Private endpoints**: Similar to service endpoints, private endpoints provide a similar benefit by avoiding SNAT port restrictions to services secured with private endpoints.

4. **NAT gateway**: With a NAT gateway, you have 64k outbound SNAT ports that are usable by the resources sending traffic through it. This can help manage SNAT port usage and prevent exhaustion.

By implementing these strategies, you can minimize the risk of encountering SNAT port exhaustion in your Azure App Service applications.


Yes, the SNAT port limitation in Azure App Service can indirectly affect the number of outbound connections. The SNAT port exhaustion occurs when the number of outbound connections to the same destination IP address and port combination exceeds the available SNAT ports. Once the SNAT port limit is reached, new outbound connections fail.

To mitigate SNAT port exhaustion, you can follow these best practices:

1. **Connection pooling**: Implement connection pooling to reduce the number of new connections needed for subsequent requests to the same destination.

2. **Service endpoints**: Use service endpoints to avoid SNAT port restrictions to services secured with service endpoints.

3. **Private endpoints**: Utilize private endpoints to avoid SNAT port restrictions to services secured with private endpoints.

4. **NAT gateway**: Configure a NAT gateway to increase the number of available SNAT ports for your Azure App Service instances.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage SNAT port usage and minimize the risk of outbound connection failure due to SNAT port exhaustion.


In Azure App Service, outbound connections to Azure SQL Server utilize Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) ports. When establishing outbound connections, Azure translates the source IP address of the App Service to an ephemeral IP address using SNAT. These ephemeral ports are referred to as SNAT ports.

The SNAT port allocation varies depending on the backend pool size and the number of frontend IPs associated with the pool. The default SNAT port allocation table specifies the number of SNAT ports allocated per frontend IP, ranging from 1,024 to 32 ports based on the backend pool size.

However, when using default port allocation, the number of SNAT ports provided is limited to a maximum of 1024 ports. Adding more frontend IPs to the pool does not increase the number of allocated SNAT ports beyond 1024 ports.

When load balancing rules are selected to use default port allocation, or outbound rules are configured with "Use the default number of outbound ports," SNAT ports are allocated based on the backend pool size. Backends receive the number of ports defined by the table, per frontend IP, up to a maximum of 1024 ports.

If a backend instance needs to send traffic to multiple destinations simultaneously, it may allocate more than 1024 ports. In this case, adding a third frontend IP will not increase the number of allocated SNAT ports beyond 1024 ports.

To mitigate SNAT port exhaustion, you can employ connection pooling within your application, which reuses existing connections rather than creating new ones for each request. Additionally, you can configure your application to use connection pooling, where requests are internally distributed across a fixed set of connections and reused when possible. This approach increases the throughput of requests and reduces the risk of SNAT port exhaustion.


SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) is a mechanism used in Azure App Service to enable outbound connections from the app service instances to external endpoints. Here's how it works:

When an Azure App Service application needs to connect to an external endpoint (e.g. Azure SQL Database, Redis Cache, etc.), the application instance does not have a public IP address assigned to it directly. Instead, the connection is routed through the App Service's load balancer, which performs SNAT to translate the internal IP address and port of the application instance to a public IP address and port from a shared pool. [1][2][3]

Specifically, the process is as follows:
1. The App Service application sends a TCP packet to an external IP address. The source IP and port are internal to the application instance. [2]
2. The TCP packet is routed from the application instance to the App Service load balancer. [2]
3. The load balancer performs SNAT, changing the source IP and port of the TCP packet to one of its own public IP addresses and ports, and sends the packet out to the internet. [2][3]
4. When the external server responds, it sends the packet back to the load balancer's public IP address and port. [2]
5. The load balancer then translates the destination back to the original internal IP address and port of the application instance, and routes the packet back to the instance. [2]

The load balancer has a limited pool of SNAT ports (typically 160 ports per public IP, with 5 public IPs per App Service stamp), which are shared across all the application instances in the stamp. [3] If the application creates too many unique outbound connections in a short period of time, it can exhaust the available SNAT ports, leading to connection failures and performance issues. [4]

To mitigate SNAT port exhaustion, the recommended approaches are:
- Modify the application to reuse connections and use connection pooling[1][4]
- Use regional VNet integration and service endpoints or private endpoints to bypass SNAT for connections to Azure services[3][4]
- Use a NAT gateway to provide a dedicated pool of 64k SNAT ports for outbound connections[4]

By following these best practices, you can ensure your Azure App Service application can reliably establish the necessary outbound connections without running into SNAT port limitations. [1][2][3][4]

Here is how to troubleshoot SNAT port issues in Azure:

## Identify SNAT Port Exhaustion
The main symptom of SNAT port exhaustion is intermittent outbound connection failures or timeouts from your Azure App Service application. This can manifest as:

- Slow response times on all or some instances
- Intermittent 5xx or "Bad Gateway" errors
- Timeout error messages
- Inability to connect to external endpoints like Azure SQL, Redis, etc. [1]

The root cause is that the App Service instance has exhausted its pool of available SNAT ports, which are used to translate the internal IP address and port to a public IP and port for outbound connections. [1][2][3]

## Monitor SNAT Port Usage
To monitor your SNAT port usage and identify potential exhaustion issues:

- Use Azure Monitor metrics to track SNAT port allocation and usage over time. Look for instances nearing the 128 port limit. [3]
- Collect network traces or use tools like `netstat` to see the active outbound connections and identify any patterns of repeated connections to the same destination. [3]
- Review Azure Load Balancer diagnostics and alerts related to SNAT port exhaustion. [3]

## Mitigate SNAT Port Exhaustion
There are a few recommended approaches to mitigate SNAT port exhaustion:

1. **Modify the application to reuse connections and use connection pooling**: This reduces the number of unique outbound connections being made. [1][4]
2. **Use regional VNet integration and service endpoints or private endpoints**: This allows connections to Azure services to bypass SNAT entirely. [3][4]
3. **Use an Azure NAT Gateway**: This provides a dedicated pool of 64,000 SNAT ports for outbound connectivity, eliminating the risk of exhaustion. [3][4]

The best solution is to combine these approaches as much as possible - use service/private endpoints for Azure services, a NAT Gateway for external connections, and optimize your application's connection usage. [1][2][3][4]

By following these troubleshooting and mitigation steps, you can identify and resolve SNAT port exhaustion issues in your Azure App Service applications.
