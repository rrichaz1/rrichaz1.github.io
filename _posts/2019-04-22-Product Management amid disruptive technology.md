“Why can’t Engineers build systems that are performant at all times?” It was interesting to hear this comment from one of our new product managers this week as we had been talking about the topic of Product Management for the last two weeks. 
There are many facets to the Product Management role. Different departments use different terminology. Also, the title is used very loosely. Some of the places Business Analysts also take on the title of Product Manager.

In the lectures we discussed the nuances between product management and product lifecycle management. Product Management is more customer oriented whereas Product Life cycle is more focused on the product from its inception to its release or even retirement.

These ideas apply to all kinds of products be it cars to software to data science. It is easy to understand when we are starting with a brand-new product right from ideate phase. It becomes hard when the product is almost 2 decades old, has transferred ownership multiple times.

Coming back to the statement from our product manager, what he really meant to say was “why cannot we build something and then forget about it?”
He has moved from Customer support role to product development recently. So, he already has the customer focus piece figured out. What the lectures this week tell us that this is just a start. The methodologies like 280 Group process now adopted as Optum Accelerate framework help new product managers learn the nuances of the role quickly. 

The phases of the Accelerate framework are:
Ideate, Define, Build, Launch, Manage.
For long running products all these steps are repeated in small incremental cycles in the form of enhancements to the product. With passage of time, there is data drift, technology drift and also requirement drift. We continue to build features on top of the existing technology. The technology itself becomes obsolete and has to be updated to meet security and performance challenges. All these changes inevitably add to technical debt. 

So it is important for a Product Manager to be aware of the Product Development Life Cycle. The concept of SDLC has been used for a long time. It can be used for defects/enhancements. The scope of PDLC is much broader or in other words SDLC is a subset of PDLC. Both of them start with requirement gathering, software development, testing and deployment to production. PDLC is SDLC over and over again.

Product Management is an iterative process and we can never build something we don’t have to change.  

This spirit of change can be seen in Robert Solow’s theory on economic growth. Before his paper was published, economists had believed that capital and labor were the main causes of economic growth. He showed that great part of the economic growth also depends on technological change. This was especially true during the time of industrial revolution. Steam powered the machines that created cloth in hours that humans would have taken days. Same goes with locomotives and other industries. Electricity was the next disruptor that brought power close to consumers. 

The technologies really brought a big boost to productivity. By 1960s organizations started expecting that every technological change will bring a big boost to productivity. That was the same time when computers were gaining popularity. The organizations expected that computers would take away a lot of monotonous tasks and increase productivity manifold. The compute power increased a hundred fold in 70s and 80s, but productivity increased by only 1%. Robert Solow’s quote “You can see the compute age everywhere but in the productivity statistic“. This gave rise to the popularity of the phrase productivity paradox. 

We have come to the realization that it is not actually a paradox. When there is technological innovation, it takes time for the people to come up with ways to use the technology. This was true when steam power was discovered. It took time before steam power could be used. The same is the case with Information Technology. The only difference is that information technology growth outpaces any other technology growth. By the time people start using one technology, another new buzz is in the market and everyone rushes to master that. It is hard to imagine that the first rudimentary internet came into being only 40 years ago. Now it is impossible to imagine a world without internet with billions of devices connected with each other. 

Machine Learning and AI are the new disruptors on the block. There is lot of promise but there are also challenges. The Diabetes data model showed a great promise as a model. There were lots of challenges during its operationalization. Being the new kid in school, it was allowed in the back seat i.e. run as the last rule after a long list of rules. This left over was not enough to show the value of the model to the end users.

I recall something similar had happened at one of the hospitals that had bought our rule-based revenue recovery product. We also offered in house revenue recovery services. The hospital staff worked on the recent denials and underpayment and our revenue recovery specialists were allowed to work the old underpayments. The tool would find underpayments and denials for the old accounts as well as the new accounts. Unfortunately for the old accounts the time of appeal would have already passed or would pass by the time paper work was submitted. This was the root cause as to why the revenue recovery services could not provide the promised ROI.

This was a human situation, but the same lack of trust is applicable to software systems or AI. It is very important that we always keep the end in sight when we start working at the models. What is the business proposition, who will be the end user, who will benefit from the model? Along with the model we have to build the trust in the model so that it can be accepted in real life situations.
