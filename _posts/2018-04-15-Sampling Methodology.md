Sampling Methodology and Evaluating Models

Controls & Investigational Design was a 2 part series and started with how humans are naturally inclined to think in terms of causality even if they know the relation is just correlation. We discussed Cronbach’s generalizability Theory and how it applies to Investigational study. Investigational Design incorporates following:
1.	Observational Study
a.	Surveys – We use survey results to study the outcomes 
b.	Correlation – A correlational study determines if two variables are correlated
c.	Natural Experiment – Natural circumstances arise that can be used to study outcomes. The control is left to chance or nature.
2.	Experimental
a.	Random assignment – Units/Subjects are assigned to treatment and control groups randomly 
b.	Quasi-Experimental  - Researcher controls the assignment of units to treatment control groups. 
“Cause is necessary for the effect but not sufficient for the effect.” This statement brings into play the confounding variable. Say a study correlates golf and heart disease. The confounding variable here is the age as older people play golf more and also are more susceptible to heart disease. 

As I was looking to understand Cronbach’s generalizability, I came across a [research paper](http://psych.colorado.edu/~willcutt/pdfs/Albright_2000.pdf).

“Behavioral scientists believe that establishing a causal relationship requires designing studies that can withstand the argument that the observed effect was caused by something other than the causal factor under consideration.”
Campbell came up with concepts of validity in experimental studies in 1957.
1.	Internal validity – How confident are we in establishing causality
2.	Statistical validity – Is there correlation between independent and dependent variables.
3.	Construct validity – Did we do what we planned to do. 
4.	External validity – Can we generalize the results of the study and apply to broader population.

“In Cronbach's system, a given study contains observations (o), such as outcome measures, of units (u), such as persons or groups, that have received treatments (t) in a given setting (S), which refers to the larger social context in which the study occurs. For Cronbach, internal validity involves generalizing beyond the particular units and realizations of the treatment and observations to the domain from which they were sampled (i.e., generalizing from utoS to UTOS). External validity concerns generalization to domains that have attributes different from those that were sampled (*UTOS).”

To ensure that the investigational design reduces the validity errors, it is very important to design the experiments carefully. The first step would be to control the covariates. Sampling plays a very important role. The main probability sampling methods that are used are:
1.	Simple Random Sampling
2.	Stratified
3.	Clustering. 

It is very interesting to see the complexities involved in choosing the samples as there are so many confounding variables that we have to consider.
